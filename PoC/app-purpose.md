I just started regularily taking my blood pressure, which gives me three values: systolic / diastolic and pulse. I never remember what is the normal range for these or how they affect each other..

That is why I want to create a simple app that allows the user to enter his blood pressure measurments, track them over time and basic analysis so the user doesnt have to remember what range and combination of measurements is considered normal.
